Topics:

1. Description of site, demo of unstyled elements, focus on simpolicity of current layout. Which elements stay, which elements go? Decisions on wording for text.

What Ora does at a very high level, keep million molecule challenge, home/science, team, contact 

2. Style choices, winning elements from example websites. Animated looping backgrounds and color Scheme from Permanance Bio, Slideshow from Gordian, custom Web animations from Talus, and the ever present scrolling pop-in on text elements.
